<h2 class="sub">From the Land of Al-ay-ek-sa</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Many, many moons ago, long before the Pale Faces invaded the land which the Indians
called Al-ay-ek-sa (Alaska, “Big Country”), the Great Spirit caused the waters to
rise and blot out all the land, even to the tops of the highest mountains.”
</p>
<p>So runs an ancient Indian legend.
</p>
<p>“At that time there was a mighty roaring like the pounding of the waves upon a rocky
shore, and suddenly death and destruction were upon the people. Some of the terror-stricken
natives fled to the mountains, but the water overtook them and they were drowned.
Only a very few escaped in their canoes. These drifted around until the water went
down and their canoes grated and came to rest on dry land. There they settled and
built their lodges and continued to follow the customs of their people.
</p>
<p>“This is how blood relations became so widely separated. So a stranger in an Indian
village may enter any lodge before which stands a totem surmounted by the crest of
his family. He is given food and shelter and may take freely that which he needs.
</p>
<p>“In the days when slaves were as plentiful as the salmon berries that grow by the
running water an Indian chief would free all his prisoners whose crest was the crest
of his clan, even if their tongue was unknown to him and sounded hostile in his ears.
</p>
<p>“But a member of the Raven clan may not marry a raven or an eagle an eagle. They belong
to the same family and are forbidden to marry.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>In that long ago time when every Indian village had its honored Story Teller, this
and many other tales were told around the campfire while the smoke curled upward and
the moon crept over the mountain. The old men grunted assent and the young men kept
silent, listening. For upon them must fall the task of handing down the legends and
customs of their people.
</p>
<p>But since the coming of the white man these Story Tellers are passing away. Only a
few remain and they are very old. The youths and maidens listen not to the tales of
their ancestors, and soon there shall be no one to keep alive the traditions of their
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e153">[<a href="#xd31e153">5</a>]</span>people who journeyed long ago to the cold land of the North.
</p>
<p>So we have set down some of the legends told by the Red Men to their children in the
Land of the Midnight Sun, where sometimes in the heavens are seen long, gorgeous-hued
fingers of light flashing here and there—“Spirits of departed warriors returned to
dance once more their war dances.”
</p>
<p>Would you know the legend of the Sun, Moon, Star and Rainbow Houses? Then read the
tale as it was told by one of the last great Indian Story Tellers.
</p>

<h2 class="main"><i>The Gift of “Tsow”</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Farther back than the memory of the oldest Red Man there once lived an old woman named
Cowoh. She was very proud for she was the daughter of a great chief. She had three
sons and one daughter. They lived in the village of Naha, which was built along one
side of a creek. On the other side, the length of twenty canoes away, was the village
of Tee-hi-ton (Cedar Bark).
</p>
<p>Now in the time of falling leaves, as was their custom, the three sons went up on
the mountain to hunt groundhogs. Each of the young men had his own lodge and a fine
hunting ground in the valley. They set their traps and three days later the two younger
brothers found their traps full, but those of the eldest brother, Koot-da-nah, were
empty. This continued for as many days as there are fingers on both hands.
</p>
<p>Then the hearts of the two young men were heavy and in sorrow for their brother they
proposed that they should give up hunting groundhogs and hunt beavers instead.
</p>
<p>So the next morning they went down to a nearby lake where the beavers had made a big
dam with a great tree to keep it from breaking.
</p>
<p>Koot-da-nah said, “I shall knock down the tree and you boys stand ready to club the
animals when the water breaks and forces them out.”
</p>
<p>His brothers were fearful and warned him to be careful, but as the tree fell Koot-da-nah
caught his foot in its roots and, pitching forward into the lake, was drowned.
</p>
<p>Atch-koog-tdoo-cha shook-ka (he-who-swims-like-a-fish) found the body face downward
on the bottom of the lake. Sorrowfully the brothers carried it to their lodge.
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e170">[<a href="#xd31e170">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Too-ke-tni-ka (the-fearless-one) said, “Some evil has fallen upon my brother’s
family in his absence and caused his death. I shall go down to the village and find
out what has happened.”
</p>
<p>So that night Too-ke-tni-ka stole down to the village and, unseen, crept into his
mother’s house.
</p>
<p>When Cowoh heard that her eldest son was drowned, she was full of trouble and said,
“Koshu, son of Chief Yee-khoo, from the village of Tee-hi-ton has looked with evil
eyes upon the wife of Koot-da-nah while he has been absent and has visited her every
night.”
</p>
<p>Then Too-ke-tni-ka said, “I shall kill this man. Do not tell anyone I am here. I shall
hide in the forest and tomorrow I shall come limping into the village as if my leg
were broken. I shall lie down beside the fire. Tell everyone I am suffering so they
will go to bed early.”
</p>
<p>The next day when the shadows lay short on the grass Too-ke-tni-ka appeared in the
village with his leg bound about with the bark of the cedar tree and went to his mother’s
lodge.
</p>
<p>That night, when everyone was asleep, he wrapped himself in his blanket and waited
with his eyes fixed on the door of the lodge.
</p>
<p>Long after darkness like a black curtain had settled down over the village Too-ke-tni-ka
crouched by the dying coals and his eyes were red in the darkness and his ears were
like the ears of the deer in the forest.
</p>
<p>At last there was a faint sound like the far-off cry of the night hawk in the woods.
The door of the lodge was pushed open and a dark shadow stole across and entered the
room of Kah-ook-too-ni, the Beautiful One.
</p>
<p>Too-ke-tni-ka’s heart beat fast with anger. He listened long and then rose and crept
noiselessly into the room of his brother’s wife. By the light of his beechwood stick
he saw that indeed it was the chief’s son who lay sleeping by the side of Kah-ook-too-ni.
Then he drew his hunting knife and cut off the head of the wicked one and taking it
with him sped like the wind through the sleeping-village to the hunting lodge in the
mountains where his brother awaited him.
</p>
<p>Now Kah-ook-too-ni was awakened by the trickling of the warm blood across her hand.
When she saw what had happened she was afraid. Knowing that when the chief’s son did
not come home there would be a great outcry and searching parties would be sent out,
she rose and in great haste dug a grave beneath the bed and buried the body.
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e183">[<a href="#xd31e183">7</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="figure plate02width"><img src="images/plate02.jpg" alt="“To Left-Handed was given a Sun House”" width="507" height="720"><p class="figureHead">“To Left-Handed was given a Sun House”</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e188">[<a href="#xd31e188">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, after Too-ke-tni-ka had told his brother all that had happened, the two
young men went down to the village and placed the head of the chief’s son over the
door of their lodge facing inside.
</p>
<p>In the village of Tee-hi-ton there was much loud talking and angry looks directed
toward Naha when the tidings spread that Koshu, the son of their chief, was missing.
Searching parties were sent out, but as the waves wash out footsteps in the sand,
so had disappeared Koshu, the fleet-footed.
</p>
<p>Then Chief Yee-khoo called a council of his people. It was decided that Wook-ya-koots
(he-of-the-sharp-eyes) should be sent to Naha to get a fire and see if he could discover
what had become of Koshu.
</p>
<p>Wook-ya-koots walked boldly across the frozen creek and entered the lodge of Too-ke-tni-ka.
As he bent over the fire to light his stick, he looked stealthily around but saw nothing.
But as he paused by the door on his way out he felt the drip, drip of something on
his feet. He went outside, and, stooping, touched it with his finger.
</p>
<p>It was blood!
</p>
<p>Pretending to stumble, he put out his fire and again returned to the lodge. As he
bent over the coals with his hair falling over his eyes, he looked and saw the head
of the chief’s son over the door.
</p>
<p>Then he made great haste back to his village and told what he had seen. Chief Yee-khoo
called all his braves together. They put on their war paint and brandishing their
war clubs, rushed across the creek and fell upon the village, killing everyone in
it and setting fire to their lodges.
</p>
<p>Only Cowoh and her daughter, who had hid under their lodge, were saved. When at last
the wild chant of the savage war dance of their enemies ceased, they stole like black
shadows through the forest to the lodge in the mountains.
</p>
<p>But after a time Cowoh’s heart was troubled.
</p>
<p>“Who now will marry my daughter?” she asked herself. “There is no man of my people
left for her to wed.”
</p>
<p>One day as she walked in the forest with her daughter, At-ku-dakt (modest-little-one)
she cried aloud, “Who now will marry my daughter?”
</p>
<p>At once a little red bird came flying down and said: “I will marry your daughter.”
</p>
<p>But Cowoh heeded him not.
</p>
<p>Then a squirrel ran down from a tree, a rabbit came out of the woods, a deer paused
in his flight, and each in turn said, “I will marry your daughter.”
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e205">[<a href="#xd31e205">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Cowoh would have none of them.
</p>
<p>Then Hoots, the great brown bear, came and said, “I can pull up huge trees by the
roots. I can tear a man’s head and body apart. I shall marry your daughter.”
</p>
<p>At-ku-dakh was terrified and hid behind her mother. Then the earth began to tremble
and the lightning flashed, and in the midst of it appeared a handsome youth who said,
“I shall marry your daughter and take her up to my father, the Almighty One. You,
Cowoh, I shall take under one arm and At-ku-dakh under the other. Look not out or
evil may come upon you.”
</p>
<p>Cowoh heeded not the warning. When they were passing a cloud she heard a sound like
the roaring of a waterfall and stuck out her head.
</p>
<p>As quickly as thunder follows the lightning, they found themselves again upon the
earth. The stranger was angry, and, pulling out one of the branches of a tree, put
Cowoh in the hole, saying, “Here you shall stay as long as the world shall last. People
shall always hear you crying in the wind.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Taking the young girl, the youth flew up to heaven where the Almighty One welcomed
her as his son’s wife.
</p>
<p>When the first son was born, the grandfather, the Great Spirit, baptized him with
water so he would have magic power. Then he put his feet on the feet of the child.
Immediately the baby grew and grew until he was tall and straight like a young pine
tree that grows on the hillside. He named the child Left-Handed.
</p>
<p>Four boys and two girls were born and in the same way the grandfather endowed them
each with magic power. He taught the boys how to use the spear and bow and arrow and
the girls how to nurse the sick. He taught Left-Handed how to stick gamble until his
skill was so great that none could equal him.
</p>
<p>Then the grandfather built in the heavens a Sun House which he gave to Left-Handed.
He built a Star House for the second boy. For the third boy he built a Rainbow House
and for the fourth boy a Sky House. Each house had a round door. Within were blankets
and food and rich robes of fur.
</p>
<p>Calling his four grandsons to him the Almighty One gave them a small box “tsow” saying,
“The time shall come when you will have to fight the wicked, worldly people of the
earth. Then take this box, open one end of it and they will at once become as the
dry leaves in autumn when the wind crumbles them into dust.”
</p>
<p>The Almighty One took the Sun House with the eldest boy and his sister and dropped
it upon the earth in the center of the deserted <span class="pageNum" id="xd31e222">[<a href="#xd31e222">10</a>]</span>village of Naha. Then he took the Moon, Star and Rainbow Houses and dropped them down
beside the Sun House.
</p>
<p>In Tee-hi-ton the people heard a loud noise like a clap of thunder. This they heard
as many times as there are fingers on one hand.
</p>
<p>The young people began to jeer, but the elders made them keep silent. “It is nothing,”
they said. “It is only Skanson the thunder bird singing his war song.” So they wrapped
themselves in their blankets and went to sleep.
</p>
<p>The next morning a thick fog hung over the creek so they could not see the length
of their canoe in front of them. But when the mist lifted they shouted in amazement,
for there among the ruins of the deserted village were four houses, painted with strange
figures such as they had never seen before.
</p>
<p>As they watched they saw young men and maidens going in and out of the houses. Then
they crowded together, asking each other fearfully, “Are these the spirits of our
enemies returned to punish us?”
</p>
<p>After many days Wook-ya-koots, the keen-eyed, said, “I, Wook-ya-koots, shall go alone
to Naha to speak with the strangers and learn from whence comes these lodges which
glimmer in the dusk like the water when we paddle idly along in the moonlight.”
</p>
<p>The people waited eagerly for Wook-ya-koots’ return, but the sun was high overhead
before he appeared. Showing them a piece of meat he said, “Look, this is real meat.
The strangers are not spirits. They gave me dried fish, the meat of the mountain sheep
and berries to eat. They are lonely and invite you to a great feast tonight.”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The feast lasted until the moon hid her face and the stars began to fade from the
sky. The next night Chief Yee-khoo and his braves came again and for many nights after.
</p>
<p>Then Left-Handed said, “Are there any stick gamblers among you? Tomorrow you shall
teach me how to stick gamble.”
</p>
<p>The sun was slipping down behind the mountains when Chief Yee-khoo and his people
arrived, for in those days the salmon might leap in the streams and the beavers build
their dams unheeded while the Red Men gambled away their blankets and food and even
their canoes.

<h2 class="main"><i>The Gamble Stick Game</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A great fire chased away the black shadows of night as the Red Men began the gamble
stick chant. First low, then louder and faster, while they beat on drums made of logs.
</p>
<p>There were six Indian braves on each side. On the ground in front of each were ten
sticks, small and straight, made of cedar. Three long sticks lay beside them. These
were to show how many times each side won. There were two gamble sticks the length
of a man’s finger. The bark had been peeled from one leaving it smooth and round,
while the other had a ring of bark around the middle.
</p>
<p>Then Wook-ya-koots took the two gamble sticks, one in each hand, and while swinging
them back and forth in front of him, changed them from one hand to the other so quickly
that no eye could follow. But at last Left-Handed made a motion toward the hand he
thought held the ring stick. The wild chanting stopped. Wook-ya-koots opened wide
his hands and showed the sticks. Left-Handed had lost and threw one of the short sticks
of cedar across to the other side. Wook-ya-koots took it and stuck it in the ground.
</p>
<p>Then the Red Men again began the gamble stick chant. This time Left-Handed guessed
the hand that held the gamble stick and Wook-ya-koots threw over a count stick and
also the gamble sticks. Chief Yee-khoo and his braves became the guessers.
</p>
<p>So the game went on until Chief Yee-khoo’s side had ten count sticks stuck in the
ground before them. Then they took them all down and put up one large count stick.
When Chief Yee-khoo’s men had three of these large count sticks the game ended and
he and his braves carried off all the rich robes and food and blankets which they
had gambled for. This they did the next night and for many nights after. Each night
<span class="corr" id="xd31e256" title="Source: Ieft-Handed">Left-Handed</span> and his brothers and sisters made a great feast for them.
</p>
<p>Always Left-Handed and his brothers lost until Chief Yee-khoo and his men had won
everything they possessed except one small club made of bone.
</p>
<p>Left-Handed took this and said, “This is the only thing we have left. It is worth
many blankets, for with it we can kill our enemies. We shall gamble for this and this
time we may be lucky and win.”
</p>
<p>Chief Yee-khoo and his braves began to jeer and ask, “How can a bone you can cover
with one hand kill anyone?”
</p>
<p>At last Left-Handed said, “If you do not believe me I shall show you.”
</p>
<p>He raised the little bone club and slew Chief Yee-khoo and <span class="pageNum" id="xd31e265">[<a href="#xd31e265">13</a>]</span>one after another all of his men except one who made his escape and aroused the people
of Tee-hi-ton. They rushed across the creek and fell upon Left-Handed and his brothers
and sisters with such fury that they were almost overpowered.
</p>
<div class="figure plate05width"><img src="images/plate05.jpg" alt="“Unheeded the salmon might leap in the stream while the Red Men played the Gamble Stick Game”" width="460" height="720"><p class="figureHead">“Unheeded the salmon might leap in the stream while the Red Men played the Gamble
Stick Game”</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Then Left-Handed remembered the little box “tsow” which his grandfather, the Almighty
One, had given them. He took the box and opened one end. At once the worldly people
were as the “dry leaves in autumn when a puff of wind crumbles them into dust.”
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e273">[<a href="#xd31e273">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>“And,” concluded the Story Teller, as we paddled lazily along, drinking in the mystic
beauty of a starlit Northern night, “to me and my people the Sun, Moon, Sky and Rainbow
are emblems the Almighty One has put in the heavens to show that the Red Men shall
increase and prosper and people the earth for as long as the sun and moon shall shine.”

<h2 class="main"><i>The Great Peace Dance</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A spring day in Alaska! Since early dawn we had paddled swiftly along in a world wrapped
in a blue haze. On our right tall fir trees rose mistily from the shore. On our left
the faint line of lofty mountain ranges melted into the blue grey of a cloudless sky.
The seagulls spiraled high overhead, then, swooping low, were lost in the white-capped
waves. The tang of the sea filled our nostrils and the rising wind whipped the spray
in our faces and sent the blood tingling through our veins.

<p>We rounded a jutting point and came in sight of the deserted village of Kasaan. Lofty
totem poles were etched against the sky. Some leaned drunkenly toward decaying lodges
half buried in underbrush.

</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Here was fought the last great battle between the Tsimpseans and Hydahs,” said the
Story Teller. “My mother has many times told me the tale as it was told to her by
her grandfather, who took a Hydah maiden for his wife. She was a blood relation of
Chief Skowel, he who was greatest of all the Hydah chiefs.<span class="corr" id="xd31e286" title="Not in source">”</span>
</p>
<p>The rain had begun to fall, so we landed and as we cooked our breakfast over the campfire
he told me the story.
</p>
<p>“You must know that some of my people came from far to the southward and settled near
the Stikine River many, many moons ago. There the Hydahs came seeking safety from
their enemies, the Tsimpseans. The streams were full of fish. There were deer in the
forest and game was plentiful. They settled there and became rich and had many elaidi
(slaves).

<p class="figureHead">“We came in sight of the deserted village of Kasaan”</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e298">[<a href="#xd31e298">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>“See how the totem poles in front of Chief Skowel’s lodge rise high above all the
others! That tells how big a chief he was. In his lodge was danced the great peace
dance which ended the long war between the Hydahs and the Tsimpseans.
</p>
<p>“Farther back than my grandfather’s father can remember the Hydahs and the Tsimpseans
had made war upon each other. They made raids at night and the maidens and young braves
taken prisoners were treated as slaves. Every time a chief became sick or died, a
totem pole was raised, or a potlatch given, some of these slaves were killed and their
bodies thrown on the beach to be eaten by the crows. The number of holes in the ears
of a chief told how many potlatches he had given.
</p>
<p>“One day the Hydahs looked and saw that the water was black with canoes. The Tsimpseans
were coming to make war upon them. Twenty young Hydah braves got into two big canoes
and went to meet them. They offered to make peace with them. But the Tsimpseans had
long looked with longing eyes on their rich hunting grounds, and refused.
</p>
<p>“The Tsimpseans had seven canoes and over a hundred men. But the Hydahs had two guns
which they had traded many furs for from the Pale Faces far to the Northward at Sheet-kah
(Sitka). They shot off the guns and the noise was like the roar of thunder. Their
enemies leaped backward in terror. Their canoes were overturned and so many were killed
that the water was red with blood.
</p>
<p>“They called upon Sha-nung-et-lag-e-das (God) but he heard them not.
</p>
<p>“So the <span class="corr" id="xd31e307" title="Source: Tsimpseams">Tsimpseans</span> surrendered and Chief Skowel gave a great peace dance. The two tribes were drawn
up facing each other. Then a young brave from each side advanced and choosing one
<span class="corr" id="xd31e310" title="Source: f">of</span> his former foes carried him off to his side. He was not allowed to walk throughout
the long ceremony and was treated with the greatest honor. This was to show that they
would now treat each other as brothers and freely visit each other’s camp fires.
</p>
<p>“If you will visit my lodge in Ketchikan, a day’s journey to the northward,” concluded
the Story Teller, “I shall show you one of the guns used in that last big fight. It
was given to me by my grandmother, she who was a blood relation of Chief Skowel. She
told me it was made in Sheet-kah (Sitka) in the days when the Russians made many guns
and cannons and built great ships to send over the Big Water. It is a flint lock and
made fine and strong. Many come to see it and offer me plenty furs or bags of the
white man’s money for it.”

<h2 class="main"><i>The Battle with the Sand Fleas</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The rain had ceased and the sun had swept aside the veil of mist disclosing a glorious
panorama of sea and sky. We stepped into our canoe and turned its nose northward.
</p>
<p>The sun was setting in a riot of gorgeous colors as we rounded Pinnoch Island and
saw the thriving little city of Ketchikan stretching for miles along the waterfront.
“Ketch-kaw” the Indians named it, meaning wedged in between two mountains. The harbor
was crowded with ships. Great concrete buildings rose against the sky. One by one
lights began to flash out from pretty homes crowding hillside and waterfront and were
reflected in the waters of Tongass Narrows. As lovely a scene as any famed Venice
can boast.
</p>
<p>Then the Story Teller broke the long silence.
</p>
<p>“It was here that the Thlingets fought and conquered the Tsimpseans. It ended the
war that began so long ago that no one can remember. One, two, perhaps three hundred
years ago.
</p>
<p>“Before that time the Thlingets and the Tsimpseans were brothers. They visited and
feasted and danced together. So it happened that two Thlinget princes looked with
favor upon a fair Tsimpsean maiden. They quarreled. Their blood relations took up
the quarrel. There were angry looks and loud words and much fighting. In one of these
fights one of the Thlinget princes was killed.
</p>
<div class="figure plate09width"><img src="images/plate09.jpg" alt="“An Old Indian War Canoe”" width="720" height="146"><p class="figureHead">“An Old Indian War Canoe”</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Then the Thlingets hated the Tsimpseans with a fierce hatred because one of their
maidens had brought this evil upon them. In those days the Indian believed in an eye
for an eye, a life for a life. So they fell upon the Tsimpseans and slew one of the
sons of their chief. Then for many, many moons they made war upon each other.
</p>
<p>“The Thlingets made a big camp at Ketch-kah. They built three great log forts. One
was where Chief Johnson’s lodge now stands.
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e336">[<a href="#xd31e336">19</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="figure plate10width"><img src="images/plate10.jpg" alt="“The Thlingets built a fort where Chief Johnson’s lodge now stands”" width="720" height="459"><div class="figAnnotation plate10width"><span class="figTop">&nbsp;</span><span class="figBottomRight">Courtesy Mrs. F.&nbsp;J.

<p class="figureHead">“The Thlingets built a fort where Chief Johnson’s lodge now stands”</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="xd31e343">[<a href="#xd31e343">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>“The Thlingets called the Tsimpseans Klah-neets (sand fleas) because they would pop
up and shoot at them, then disappear in the sand and underbrush, or would steal into
their camp and carry off their young men and maidens and make slaves of them. They
came noiselessly and were gone, leaving no footprints.
</p>
<p>“The Tsimpseans had one small cannon. They had gotten it from the Hudson Bay Company,
far to the southward, in exchange for furs. While their enemies slept, they carried
the cannon to the top of the hill and fired on the fort. Then a terrible battle was
fought. The Thlingets seized their war clubs and fell upon the Tsimpseans with such
fury that almost all of them were either killed or taken prisoner. Then the Tsimpsean
tribe laid down their war clubs and again lived in peace with the Thlingets.
</p>
<p>“But,” said the Story Teller, “my people were still at war with a Thlinget clan that
made their camp at Sheet-kah. It started longer, much longer ago than the war with
the Tsimpseans. They fought with bows and arrows and with clubs made of bone.
</p>
<p>“This was the way the big fight started. Every year my people would take plenty salmon
over to Pinnock Island and hang it there to dry for their winter food.
</p>
<p>“The Sheet-kah Indians had fine big canoes. They made them of rotten spruce logs,
which they hollowed out with sharp stones. Some of them held thirty or forty people.
In them they would paddle as far south as Dixon’s Entrance fishing and trading. Once
they landed on Pinnock Island and carried off all the salmon they found there.
</p>
<p>“That winter was long and cold and there was very little food. The old and many young
children died. Then the hearts of my people grew hot with anger. There was a big fight
and Chief Nah-goot was killed by Schook-klatch, chief of the Sheet-kah tribe. Then
they fight, fight, all the time fight until Captain Cook came. He was the first Pale
Face my people had ever seen. Soon the Red Men began trading furs for guns with which
to fight each other.
</p>
<p>“But at last the great white chief in Washington sent his soldiers to tell the Red
Men that they must live in peace with each other. There must be no more fighting.
</p>
<p>“Now,” said the Store Teller proudly, “my people live like their white brothers. Our
children go to school. We have fine big fishing boats. Our lodges are like the white
men’s lodges.
</p>
<p>“There,” pointing to where half a mile away a long pier extended far out from the
little village of Saxman, “I hope some day to see an Indian village like the white
men’s villages, where <span class="pageNum" id="xd31e355">[<a href="#xd31e355">21</a>]</span>my people will be able to do all that my white brothers do. Its harbor will be crowded
with fishing boats. There shall be canneries and sawmills so our children need not
seek work in the villages of the white men. The Indian will no longer be a child.
He will be a man.
</p>
<p>“But,” the Story Teller ended sadly, “the young look not with the eyes of the old.
I dream, but my dreams may not come true.”

<h2 class="main"><i>The First Lincoln Statue</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“It was one of my people, Thle-da, the most skillful carver of all the Thlinget nation,
who carved that totem in honor of the great white chief, Abraham Lincoln,” said the
Story Teller proudly as he pointed to a lofty totem pole from which the benign face
of the great emancipator looked down upon a deserted Indian village.
</p>
<p>The setting sun had changed the misty blue of Northern skies into a marvelous canopy
of red and gold. It bathed the distant snow-capped mountains in a rosy light and sent
a warm golden glow over the quiet waters of Nakat Bay as he told the story of how
over fifty years ago his tribe had sought shelter under the Stars and Stripes and
been saved from slavery or complete extermination.
</p>
<p>“My people are of the Tongass tribe of the Thlingets,” he went on. “They are of the
Raven clan. Long before the Pale Faces journeyed to the land which the white man calls
Alaska, they were at war with the Kok-wan-tans, who belonged to the Eagle clan of
the Thlingets and were always on the war path. They burned our lodges. They carried
off our fairest maidens and our young men and made slaves of them.
</p>
<p>“At last only a few stalwart braves were left to guard our old men and women and children.
They were driven farther and farther away until they found shelter on a low, sandy
island a day’s journey from their old hunting grounds near Dixon’s Entrance.
</p>
<p>“There their enemies could not fall upon them unawares, for the land was level as
the palm of my hand. They built a great fort of logs and slept always with their clubs
by their side.
</p>
<p>“But the Kok-wan-tans knew that on the island there were no springs of water and little
wood for their campfires. So they waited with the watchful patience of the Red Man
for the time when no longer the smoke of their campfires should curl upward.
</p>
<p>“One day Kayak, a friendly Indian, noiselessly paddled into the <span class="pageNum" id="xd31e369">[<a href="#xd31e369">22</a>]</span>little cove near the lodge and landed. He told them of a strange ship, like a great
bird, that had come from far to the southward. On it were many Pale Faces. They had
built a big fort on the island of Kut-tuk-wah and the Red Men were no longer allowed
to make war on each other.
</p>
<p>“They had been sent, Kayak said, by their chief, Abraham Lincoln. He had freed the
Black Men who had been slaves to the Pale Faces for many moons. Now he had sent his
soldiers to free the Red Men. The Kok-wan-tans must wash off their war paint and bury
their war clubs.
</p>
<p>“So,” continued the Story Teller, “my people watched and when their enemies were sleeping
they took their canoes and fled to this island, which the white men now call Tongass
Island. Here, guarded by the great ship “Lincoln,” Chief Ebbetts and his people built
their lodges and again raised their totem poles.
</p>
<p>“For many years they lived in peace and prospered.
</p>
<p>“But the Red Man forgets not. The Tongass Indians were grateful to their white brothers.
They listened when Chief Sewrard visited them and told them of the great white chief
who loved the Red Man.
</p>
<p>“ ‘We are thankful,’ they said. ‘Our hearts salute him. No longer need we fear lest
we be made slaves and buried beneath the totem poles of our enemies.’
</p>
<p>“One day Chief Ebbetts summoned his sub-chief Tsa-kad and said, ‘I am weary. Soon
I shall sleep the long sleep of the old. But my heart turns to my brother, the great
white chief Abraham Lincoln, for what he has done for my people. We shall make a lofty
totem pole and above the Raven, the crest of our tribe, we shall carve a statue of
Chief Lincoln.’
</p>
<p>“So Thle-da, my father’s brother—he who could talk so marvelously with his fingers—was
given a picture of Chief Lincoln from which to carve the statue. He worked while others
slept and in the moon of nesting birds it was finished.
</p>
<p>“Then Chief Ebbetts gave a big potlatch to which all the people in the village were
invited. The great totem pole was erected and for many days there was dancing and
feasting. Around the camp fire the elders again told how Abraham Lincoln had stretched
out his hands to them and saved them.
</p>
<p>“But,” and the Story Teller shook his head mournfully, “the ancient village of my
people is now deserted. Their lodges are overgrown with weeds. Even our Abraham Lincoln
totem is crumbling away.
</p>
<p>“In these days when men fly like birds and the voice travels swifter than an arrow
to its mark, surely Alaska is no longer <span class="pageNum" id="xd31e383">[<a href="#xd31e383">23</a>]</span>thought a shak-nah-ahm (foreign) country, and our white chief in Washington will listen
and grant the wish of his children that this island with the first statue ever erected
to Abraham Lincoln be cared for so we may bring our children’s children to look upon
it.”

<h2 class="main"><i>A Native Alaskan Artist</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">France has its Millet, Italy its Raphael, and the natives of Alaska look with almost
equal pride upon their Tsimpsean artist, Henry S. Haldane. He does not know when he
was born. It was long before Father Duncan brought his gift of the gospel to the Alaskan
Indians. But no one can view the paintings of this self-taught native without feeling
that—with proper training—the divine spark implanted in him would have brought rich
fruitage.
</p>
<p>On the wall of Father Duncan’s church in Metlakatla hangs a picture of an open Bible.
So perfect is it that you will have to look closely to see that it is painted on canvas.
It is the work of this artist, painted over thirty years ago. A hundred years from
now it will be preserved in our national museum as one of the most valuable of early
Alaskan art treasures.
</p>
<p>“Christ’s Agony in Gethsemane” was recently painted by Haldane for the new Salvation
Army Hall in Metlakatla, although he is now almost blind. The paintings of the Sun,
Star, Moon and Rainbow Houses reproduced in this book are his work.
</p>
<p>The first native photographer in Alaska, unassisted, he acquired a knowledge of photography
that for a time opened up to him an interesting field of work. But six years ago unkind
Fate dealt him a cruel blow. Born blind in one eye, an accident made him almost blind
in the other eye. While chopping wood a chip struck the eyeball, hopelessly injuring
it.
</p>
<p>Still the urge to create is strong within him. With amazing perfection of detail and
color he paints pictures and carves the totem poles which portray so vividly the history
and legends of the Alaskan Indians.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
